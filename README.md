# NuclearForces
This site contains all teaching material for PHY989: Nuclear forces

The teaching material gives a survey of our present understanding of nuclear forces, from phenomenological models and one-boson exchange models to effective field theory and the fundamental theory of the strong force, quantum chromodynamics. 
The course contains several hands-on exercises and projects, ranging from the solution of the Lippman-Schwinger equation to the derivation of three-body forces in chiral perturbation theory. The course covers
1) Introduction to nuclear forces, functional expressions based on experimental information
2) Relativistic quantum mechanics and elements of quantum field theory, Dirac's equation and computation of one-boson exchange contributions. 
3) Derivation of non-relativistic expressions of nuclear forces from one-boson exchange models
4) Elements of scattering theory and the non-relativistic Lippman-Schwinger equation 
5) Symmetries of nuclear forces, chiral symmetry, PCAC, pion decay constant, Goldstone bosons  and links with QCD
6) Effective field theory and nuclear forces, two-, three- and many-nucleon forces, how and why
7) From Lattice QCD to effective field theory, how do we link them?
8) Connections with nuclear few- and many-body theories and implications for nuclear structure and reaction studies
