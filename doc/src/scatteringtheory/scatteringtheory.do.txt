===== Nuclear forces =====
!bblock
To derive the above famous form of the nuclear force using field theoretical concepts, we will need some 
elements from relativistic quantum mechanics. These derivations will be given below. 
The material here gives some background to this.
I know that many of you have not taken a course in quantum field theory. I hope however that you can see the basic ideas leading to the famous non-relativistic expressions for the nuclear force. 

_Furthermore, when we analyze nuclear data, we will actually try to explain properties like spectra, single-particle energies etc in terms of the various terms of the nuclear force. Moreover, many of you will hear about these terms at various talks, workshops, seminars etc. Then, it is good to have an idea of what people actually mean!!_

===== Components of the force and quantum numbers =====

But before we proceed, we will look into specific quantum numbers of the relative system and study 
expectation vaues of the various terms of
!bt
\[
V(\mathbf{r})= \left\{ C_c + C_\mathbf{\sigma} \mathbf{\sigma}_1\cdot\mathbf{\sigma}_2
 + C_T \left( 1 + {3\over m_\alpha r} + {3\over

===== Relative and CoM system, quantum numbers =====
!bblock

When solving the scattering equation or solving the two-nucleon problem, it is convenient to rewrite the Schroedinger equation, due to
the spherical symmetry of the Hamiltonian, in relative and center-of-mass coordinates. This will also define the quantum numbers of the relative and center-of-mass system and will aid us later in solving
the so-called Lippman-Schwinger equation for the scattering problem. 

We define the center-of-mass (CoM)  momentum as
!bt
 \[
    \mathbf{K}=\sum_{i=1}^A\mathbf{k}_i,
 \]
!et
with $\hbar=c=1$ the wave number $k_i=p_i$, with $p_i$ the pertinent momentum of a single-particle state. 
We have also the relative momentum
!bt
\[
    \mathbf{k}_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{k}_i-\mathbf{k}_j).
 \]
!et
We will below skip the indices $ij$ and simply write $\mathbf{k}$
!eblock

!split
===== Relative and CoM system, quantum numbers =====
!bblock

In a similar fashion we can define the CoM coordinate
!bt
 \[
     \mathbf{R}=\frac{1}{A}\sum_{i=1}^{A}\mathbf{r}_i,
 \]
!et
 and the relative distance 
!bt
\[
    \mathbf{r}_{ij}=(\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j).
 \]

\[
    \mathbf{k}_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{k}_i-\mathbf{k}_j).
 \]
!et
we can rewrite the two-particle kinetic energy (note that we use $\hbar=c=1$ as 
!bt
\[
\frac{\mathbf{k}_1^2}{2m_n}+\frac{\mathbf{k}_2^2}{2m_n}=\frac{\mathbf{k}^2}{m_n}+\frac{\mathbf{K}^2}{4m_n},
\]
!et
where $m_n$ is the average of the proton and the neutron masses.

===== Relative and CoM system, quantum numbers =====
!bblock

Since the two-nucleon interaction depends only on the relative distance, this means that we can separate Schroedinger's equation in an equation for the center-of-mass motion and one for the relative motion.

With an equation for the relative motion only and a separate one for the center-of-mass motion we need to redefine the two-body quantum numbers.

Previously we had a two-body state vector defined as $|(j_1j_2)JM_J\rangle$ in a coupled basis. 
We will now define the quantum numbers for the relative motion. Here we need to define new orbital momenta (since these are the quantum numbers which change). 
We define 
!bt
\[
\hat{l}_1+\hat{l}_2=\hat{\lambda}=\hat{l}+\hat{L},
\]
!et
where $\hat{l}$ is the orbital momentum associated with the relative motion and
$\hat{L}$ the corresponding one linked with the CoM. The total spin $S$ is unchanged since it acts in a different space. We have thus that
!bt
\[
\hat{J}=\hat{l}+\hat{L}+\hat{S},
\]
!et
which allows us to define the angular momentum of the relative motion
!bt
\[
{ \cal J} =  \hat{l}+\hat{S},
\]
!et
where ${ \cal J}$ is the total angular momentum of the relative motion.

===== Phenomenology of nuclear forces =====
!bblock

The total two-nucleon state function has to be anti-symmetric. The total function contains a spatial part, a spin part and an isospin part. If isospin is conserved, this leads to in case we have an $s$-wave with spin $S=0$ to an isospin 
two-body state with $T=1$ since the spatial part is symmetric and the spin part is anti-symmetric. 

Since the projections for $T$ are $T_z=-1,0,1$, we can have a $pp$, an $nn$ and a $pn$ state.

For $l=0$ and $S=1$, a so-called triplet state, $^3S_1$, we must have $T=0$, meaning that we have only one state, a $pn$ state. For other partial waves, the following table lists states up to $f$ waves.
We can systemize this in a table as follows, recalling that $|\mathbf{l}-\mathbf{S}| \le |\mathbf{J}| \le |\mathbf{l}+\mathbf{S}|$,  

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====
!bblock
What follows now is a more technical discussion on how we can solve the two-nucleon problem.
This will lead us to the so-called Lippman-Schwinger equation for the scattering problem and a rewrite of Schroedinger's equation in relative and center-of-mass coordinates. 


Before we break down the Schroedinger equation into a partial wave decomposition, we derive now the so-called Lippman-Schwinger equation. We will do this in an operator form first.
Thereafter, we rewrite it in terms of various quantum numbers such as relative momenta, orbital momenta etc. 
The Schroedinger equation in abstract vector representation is
!bt
\[
  \left( \hat{H}_0 + \hat{V} \right) \vert \psi_n \rangle = E_n \vert\psi_n \rangle. 
\]
!et
In our case for the two-body problem $\hat{H}_0$ is just the kinetic energy. 
We rewrite it as 
!bt
\[
\left( \hat{H}_0 -E_n \right)\vert\psi_n \rangle =-\hat{V}\vert \psi_n \rangle . 
\]
!et
We assume that the invers of $\left( \hat{H}_0 -E_n\right)$ exists and rewrite this equation as
!bt
\[
\vert\psi_n \rangle =\frac{1}{\left( E_n -\hat{H}_0\right)}\hat{V}\vert \psi_n \rangle . 
\]
!et
!eblock

===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====
!bblock
The equation
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_n \rangle =\frac{1}{\left( E_n -\hat{H}_0\right)}\hat{V}\vert \psi_n \rangle,
\]
!et
is normally solved in an iterative fashion. 
We assume first that
!bt
\[
\vert\psi_n \rangle = \vert\phi_n \rangle,
\] 
!et
where $\vert\phi_n \rangle$ are the eigenfunctions of 
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_0\vert \phi_n \rangle=\omega_n\vert \phi_n \rangle
\]
!et
the so-called unperturbed problem. In our case, these will simply be the kinetic energies of the relative motion. 
!eblock

!split
===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====
!bblock
Inserting  $\vert\phi_n \rangle$  on the right-hand side of 
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_n \rangle =\frac{1}{( E_n -\hat{H}_0)}\hat{V}\vert \psi_n \rangle,
\]
!et
yields
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_n \rangle =\vert\phi_n \rangle+\frac{1}{\left( E_n -\hat{H}_0\right)}\hat{V}\vert \phi_n \rangle,
\]
!et
as our first iteration. 
Reinserting again gives
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_n \rangle =\vert\phi_n \rangle+\frac{1}{\left( E_n -\hat{H}_0\right)}\hat{V}\vert \phi_n \rangle+\frac{1}{( E_n -\hat{H}_0)}\hat{V}\frac{1}{\left( E_n -\hat{H}_0\right)}\hat{V}\vert \phi_n \rangle,
\]
!et
and continuing we obtain
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_n \rangle =\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\left[\frac{1}{( E_n -\hat{H}_0)}\hat{V}\right]^i\vert \phi_n \rangle.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====
!bblock
It is easy to see that 
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_n \rangle =\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\left[\frac{1}{(E_n -\hat{H}_0)}\hat{V}\right]^i\vert \phi_n \rangle,
\]
!et
can be rewritten as 
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_n \rangle =\vert\phi_n \rangle+\frac{1}{( E_n -\hat{H}_0)}
\hat{V}\left(1+ \frac{1}{(E_n -\hat{H}_0)}\hat{V}+\frac{1}{(E_n -\hat{H}_0)}\hat{V}\frac{1}{(E_n -\hat{H}_0)}\hat{V}+\dots\right]\vert \phi_n \rangle,
\]
!et
which we rewrite as 
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_n \rangle =\vert\phi_n \rangle+\frac{1}{(E_n -\hat{H}_0)}\hat{V}\vert \psi_n \rangle.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====
!bblock
In operator form we have thus
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_n \rangle =\vert\phi_n \rangle+\frac{1}{(E_n -\hat{H}_0)}\hat{V}\vert \psi_n \rangle.
\]
!et
We multiply from the left with $\hat{V}$ and $\langle \phi_m \vert$ and obtain
!bt
\[
\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{V}\vert \psi_n \rangle =\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{V}\vert\phi_n \rangle+\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{V}\frac{1}{(E_n -\hat{H}_0)}\hat{V}\vert \psi_n \rangle.
\]
!et
We define thereafter the so-called $T$-matrix as
!bt
\[
\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{T}\vert \phi_n \rangle=\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{V}\vert \psi_n \rangle.
\]
!et
We can rewrite our equation as
!bt
\[
\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{T}\vert \phi_n \rangle =\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{V}\vert\phi_n \rangle+\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{V}\frac{1}{(E_n -\hat{H}_0)}\hat{T}\vert \phi_n \rangle.

The equation
!bt
\[
\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{T}\vert \phi_n \rangle =\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{V}\vert\phi_n \rangle+\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{V}\frac{1}{(E_n -\hat{H}_0)}\hat{T}\vert \phi_n \rangle,
\]
!et
is called the Lippman-Schwinger equation. Inserting the completeness relation
!bt
\[ 
\mathbf{1} = \sum_n \vert \phi_n\rangle\langle \phi_n \vert, \:\: \langle \phi_n\vert \phi_{n'} \rangle = \delta_{n,n'}
\]
!et
we have 
!bt
\[
\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{T}\vert \phi_n \rangle =\langle \phi_m \vert\hat{V}\vert\phi_n \rangle+\sum_k \langle \phi_m \vert\hat{V}\vert \phi_k\rangle\frac{1}{(E_n -\omega_k)}\langle \phi_k \vert\hat{T}\vert \phi_n \rangle,
\]
!et
which is (when we specify the state $\vert\phi_n \rangle$) an integral equation that can actually be solved by matrix inversion easily! The unknown quantity is the $T$-matrix.
!eblock

!split
===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====
!bblock
Now we wish to introduce a partial wave decomposition in order to solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation. With a partial wave decomposition we can reduce a three-dimensional integral equation to a one-dimensional one. 

Let us continue with our Schroedinger equation in the abstract vector representation
!bt
\[
\left(T + V\right)\vert\psi_n\rangle = E_n\vert\psi_n \rangle 
\]
!et
Here $T$ is the kinetic energy operator and $V$ is the potential operator. 
The eigenstates form a complete orthonormal set according to 
!bt
\[ 
\mathbf{1}=\sum_n\vert\psi_n\rangle\langle\psi_n\vert, \:\: \langle\psi_n\vert\psi_{n'}\rangle =\delta_{n,n'}
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====
!bblock
The most commonly used representations are the coordinate and
the momentum space representations. They define the completeness relations 
!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \mathbf{1}&=&  \int d\mathbf{r} \:\vert\mathbf{r} \rangle \langle \mathbf{r}\vert, \:\: \langle  \mathbf{r}\vert  \mathbf{r'} \rangle = \delta ( \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}) \\
\mathbf{1} &=& \int d\mathbf{k} \:\vert  \mathbf{k}\rangle \langle \mathbf{k}\vert, \:\: \langle\mathbf{k}\vert  \mathbf{k'} \rangle = \delta ( \mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k'}) 
\end{eqnarray*}
!et
Here the basis states in  both $\mathbf{r}$- and $\mathbf{k}$-space are dirac-delta 
function normalized. From this it follows that the plane-wave states are given by,
!bt
\[
\langle\mathbf{r}\vert\mathbf{k} \rangle =\left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\right)^{3/2}\exp\left(i\mathbf{k\cdot r} \right)
\]
!et
which is a transformation function defining the mapping from the abstract 
$\vert\mathbf{k}\rangle$ to the abstract $\vert\mathbf{r}\rangle $ space.
!eblock

!split
===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====
!bblock
That the $\mathbf{r}$-space basis states are 
delta-function normalized follows from 
!bt
\[
\delta ( \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}) = \langle \mathbf{r} \vert \mathbf{r}'\rangle = \langle \mathbf{r} \vert \mathbf{1} \vert \mathbf{r}'\rangle = \int d\mathbf{k} \langle \mathbf{r}\vert \mathbf{k} \rangle \langle \mathbf{k}\vert \mathbf{r}' \rangle =\left( {1\over 2\pi}\right)^3 \int d\mathbf{k} e^{i \mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}')} 
\]
!et
and the same for the momentum space basis states,
!bt
\[
\delta ( \mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k'}) = \langle \mathbf{k} \vert \mathbf{k}'\rangle = \langle \mathbf{k} \vert \mathbf{1} \vert \mathbf{k}'\rangle =\int d\mathbf{r} \langle \mathbf{k}\vert \mathbf{r} \rangle \langle \mathbf{r}\vert \mathbf{k}' \rangle = \left( {1\over 2\pi}\right)^3 \int d\mathbf{r} e^{i \mathbf{r}(\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}')} 
\]

===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====

Projecting  on momentum states, we obtain the momentum space Schroedinger equation as
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu}k^2\psi_n(\mathbf{k})+\int d\mathbf{k'}V(\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{k'}) \psi_n(\mathbf{k'})=E_n \psi_n(\mathbf{k})
label{eq:momspace1}
\end{equation}
!et
Here the notation $\psi_n(\mathbf{k}) =\langle\mathbf{k}\vert\psi_n\rangle $ and 
$\langle\mathbf{k}\vert V\vert\mathbf{k}' \rangle =V(\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{k'})$ has been introduced.
The potential in momentum space is given by a double Fourier-transform 
of the potential in coordinate space, i.e.
!bt
\[ 
V(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k'}) = \left( \frac{1}{2\pi}\right)^3\int d\mathbf{r}\int d\mathbf{r}'\exp{-i\mathbf{kr}}V(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')\exp{i\mathbf{k}'\mathbf{r}'}  
\]

===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====

Here it is assumed that the potential interaction does not contain any spin dependence. 
Instead of a differential equation in coordinate space, the Schroedinger
equation becomes an integral equation in momentum space. This has 
many tractable features. Firstly, most realistic 
nucleon-nucleon interactions derived from field-theory are given 
explicitly in momentum space. Secondly, the boundary conditions imposed
on the differential equation in coordinate space are automatically built into the
integral equation. And last, but not least, integral equations are easy to numerically 
implement, and convergence is obtained by just increasing the number of integration
points.
Instead of solving the three-dimensional integral equation, an 
infinite set of 1-dimensional equations can be obtained via a  partial wave
expansion.

The wave function $\psi_n(\mathbf{k})$ can be expanded in a complete set of spherical harmonics, that is
!bt
\begin{equation}

By inserting equation (ref{eq:part_wave1}) in equation (ref{eq:momspace1}), and projecting from the left
$Y_{lm}(\hat{k})$, the three-dimensional Schroedinger equation~(ref{eq:momspace1}) is reduced
to an infinite set of  1-dimensional angular momentum coupled integral equations, 
!bt

!et
where the angular momentum projected potential takes the form,

\begin{equation}

  label{eq:pot1}

here $d\hat{k} = d\theta\sin(\theta)d\varphi$.
Note that we discuss only the orbital momentum, we will include angular momentum and spin later.

The potential is often given in position space. It is then convenient to establish 
the connection between $V_{lm, l'm'}(k,k')$ and $V_{lm, l'm'}(r,r')$. Inserting 
the completeness relation for the position quantum numbers in equation (ref{eq:pot1}) results in
!bt

Since the plane waves depend only on the absolute values of position and momentum, $\vert\mathbf{k}\vert$ and

zero rank, i.e.

No assumptions of locality/non-locality and deformation of the interaction has so far been made, 
and the result in equation~(ref{eq:pot3}) is general. In position space the Schroedinger equation 
takes form of an integro-differential equation in case of a non-local interaction, 
in momentum space the Schroedinger equation is an ordinary integral equation of the Fredholm type, 
see equation~(ref{eq:part_wave2}). This is a further advantage of the momentum space approach as compared to 
the standard position space approach.  
If we assume that the 
interaction is of local character, i.e. 
!bt
\[
  \langle \mathbf{r}\vert V \vert \mathbf{r'}\rangle = V(\mathbf{r}) \delta( \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}' ) = 
  V(\mathbf{r}) {\delta( { r}-{r}' ) \over r^2} \delta ( \cos \theta - \cos \theta' ) \delta (\varphi-\varphi'), 
\]

then equation~(ref{eq:pot4}) reduces to

At low energy, $k \rightarrow 0$, S-waves are most important. In this region we can define the scattering length $a$ and the effective range $r$. The $S-$wave scattering amplitude is given by
\[
f_l(\theta) = \frac{1}{k}\frac{1}{\cot \delta_l(k) - i}.
\]
Taking the limit $k \rightarrow 0$, gives us the expansion
\[
k \cot \delta_0 = -\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{2}r_0 k^2 + \ldots
\]
Thus the low energy cross section is given by
\[
\sigma = 4\pi a^2.
\]
If the system contains a bound state, the scattering length will become positive (neutron-proton in $^3S_1$). For the $^1S_0$ wave, the scattering length is negative and large. This indicates that the wave function of the system is at the verge of turning over to get a node, but cannot create a bound state in this wave.

have been measured at almost all energies up to the pion production
threshold (290 MeV in the Lab frame), and this experimental data base
is what provides us with the constraints on our nuclear interaction
models. In order to pin down the unknown coupling constants of the
theory, a statistical optimization with respect to cross sections need
to be carried out. This is how we constrain the nucleon-nucleon
interaction in practice!

The $pp$-data is more accurate than the $np$-data, and for $nn$ there is no data. The quality of a potential is gauged by the $\chi^2$/datum with respect to the scattering data base

Note that the Nijm93 PWA phase shift becomes negative at T$_{\mathrm{lab}}> 250$MeV. This indicates that the nucleon-nucleon potential is repulsive at short distances

===== Project 1: Program for the Lippman-Schwinger equation =====
The aim here is to develop a program which solves the Lippman-Schwinger equation for a simple parametrization for the 
$^1S_0$ partial wave. This partial wave is given by a central force only and is parametrized in coordinate space as
!bt
\[
  V(r)=V_a \frac{e^{-ax}}{x}+V_b \frac{e^{-bx}}{x}+V_c \frac{e^{-cx}}{x}
\]
!et
with $x=\mu r$, $\mu=0.7$ fm (the inverse of the pion mass),
$V_a=-10.463$ MeV and $a=1$, $V_b=-1650.6$ MeV and $b=4$ and
$V_c=6484.3$ MeV and $c=7$. 

Find an analytical expression for 
the Fourier-Bessel transform (Hankel transform)
to momentum space for $l=0$ using
!bt
\[
\left\langle k \right | V_{l} \left | k' \right\rangle
= \int j_l(kr)V(r)j_l(k'r)r^2dr.
\]
!et

Write a small program which calculates the latter expression
and use this potential to compute the $T$-matrix at positive energies
for $l=0$.
Compare your results to those obtained with a  box potential given by
!bt
\[
V(r)=\left\{ \begin{array}{cc} -V_0& r < R_0 \\
                                0  & r > R_0 \end{array} \right.
\]
!et
Make a plot of the
two $T$-matrices for energies up to 300 MeV in the lab frame
and comment your results.

Finally, a warning, the above central potential is fitted  
to data from approximately 
20 MeV to some 300 MeV. This means that results outside
the data set should be taken seriously.
The parameters of the box potential are chosen to fit a
potential with a bound state at zero energy. What does this mean
for your $T$-matrix with this potential when
$k\rightarrow 0$?
