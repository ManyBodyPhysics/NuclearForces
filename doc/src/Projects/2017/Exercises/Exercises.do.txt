===== Exercise: Questions on the Overview of QCD =====
This collection of problems contain short exercises and discussion questions on QCD.
!bsubex
With respect to what scale(s) are the $c,b,t$ quarks called heavy?
!esubex

!bsubex
Have you heard about the $s$ quark before? If yes, in what context?
!esubex
!bsubex
A possible way to *see* quarks and gluons is in jets. What happens in these events?
!esubex

!bsubex
Using the "Particle Data Group website":"http://pdg.lbl.gov/", discuss which properties of the
neutron and proton are similar and what are differences? What about for the three pions?
!esubex
!bsubex
Which is more important in making a neutron more massive than a proton: the light quark mass difference or the electromagnetic
contribution? Or do you think such considerations are too simplistic?
!esubex
!bsubex
 What is the evidence for *spontaneous* chiral symmetry  breaking in
   * the mass spectrum of pseudoscalar ($J^\pi = 0^-$) mesons;
   * the mass spectrum of vector and axial vector ($J^\pi = 1^\mp$) mesons?
!esubex
!bsubex
      What is the evidence for *explicit* chiral symmetry breaking
      in the  spectrum of pseudoscalar ($J^\pi = 0^-$) mesons?
!esubex      
!bsubex      
      If you and your friend each do a QCD calculation with the
      same diagrams but use $\alpha_s$ at different scales, will you
      get the same answer? If not, how could that happen?
!esubex      
!bsubex
      Does the running coupling in QCD mean that the QCD
      Hamiltonian is not unique? Would you say that if you used
      $\alpha_s$ at two different scales that you were using two
      different Hamiltonians?
!esubex
!bsubex
If the neutron lifetime is so short, why are there *any* stable nuclei?
!esubex
!bsubex
One observes a marked resonance when a $\pi^+$ pion is
      scattering off a proton. Which baryon does this correspond to
      and at which energy of the $\pi^+$ does this occur (the proton
      is at rest)?
!esubex
!bsubex
At sufficient energy in proton-proton collisions it is
      possible to create a pion, $p + p \rightarrow p + n + \pi^+$. At
      which energy in the center-of-mass frame does pion production
      start?
!esubex

===== Exercise: Basic Scattering Theory =====

!bsubex
We typically use units in which $\hbar=c=1$ and express
      quantities as powers of MeV or fm or both, using $\hbar c\approx 197.33$ MeVfm to convert between them. If we take for the nucleon
      mass $M_N=939$ MeV/$c^2$, what is $\hbar^2/M_N$ numerically
      in terms of MeV and fm?
!bhint
Hint: This should be almost immediate if you insert the right factors of $c$.
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
For the scattering of equal mass (nonrelativistic) particles, 
      if the laboratory energy $E_{\rm lab}$ is related to the magnitude of the relative momentum 
      $k_{\rm rel}$ (i.e., the momentum each particle has in the center-of-mass
      frame) by $E_{\rm lab} = C k_{\rm rel}^2$, what is $C$?  If the mass
      is $M_N=939$ MeV, what is the value of $C$ in MeVfm$^2$? 
!esubex

!bsubex
We write the partial-wave momentum space Schroedinger equation ("see Lecture notes":"https://manybodyphysics.github.io/NuclearForces/doc/pub/scatteringtheory/html/scatteringtheory.html") as
!bt
\[
\frac{k^2}{2\mu}\langle klm | \psi \rangle + \frac{2}{\pi}\sum_{l'm'}
        \int_0^\infty\! dk'\,k'{}^2\, 
        \langle klm | V | k'l'm' \rangle \langle k'l'm' | \psi \rangle = E_k \langle klm | \psi \rangle \;,
\]
!et
      what are the units of $V_{ll'}(k,k') \equiv   \langle klm | V | k'l'm \rangle$? In coordinate space the potential is local, $V(r)$, with units of MeV, and $k$ is given in inverse fm.  If you see a plot in a journal
      article
      of $V_{ll'}(k,k')$ with units of fm, how would you convert it to the units you just found?
!bhint
Hint: use the results from the first exercise here.
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
In Figure 18 of the review by Scott Bogner *et al.*,
      "Prog.  Nucl. Part. Phys. _65_, 94 (2010)":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146641010000347?via%3Dihub" the momentum-space
      matrix elements of different chiral effective field theory
      potentials are given in units of fm. Consider the value at zero
      relative momenta. 
      $\tilde{C}_{^1S_0}$, see Eq.~(2.5) and 
     the "article by Epelbaum":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375947404010747" *et al.*  in GeV$^{-2}$. How do you convert
      to fm units? Do the values for the matrix elements then match?

!esubex

!bsubex
What do *on-shell* and *off-shell* mean in the context of scattering?
!esubex

!bsubex
Under what conditions is a partial-wave expansion of the potential useful?
!esubex

!bsubex
Derive the standard result:
!bt
\[
       \frac{e^{i\delta_l(k)}\sin\delta_l(k)}{k}
            = \frac{1}{k\cot\delta_l(k) - i k}
\]
!et
!esubex

!bsubex
Given a potential that is not identically zero as $r\rightarrow\infty$ (e.g., a Yukawa),
     how would you know in practice where the asymptotic (large $r$) region starts?
!esubex

!bsubex
What is the physical interpretation of the relation between the (partial-wave)
    $S$-matrix and the scattering amplitude?  (Note that $S_l(k) = 1 + 2 i k f_l(k)$.) 
!esubex


===== Exercise: More on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation =====
!bsubex
Using the Schr\"odinger equation for the scattering of two particles with mass $m$,
!bt
\[
       (H_0 + V)|\psi_E\rangle = E |\psi_E\rangle \;,
\]
!et
     where $H_0$ is the free Hamiltonian, show that the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the wave function,
!bt
\[
       |\psi_E^{\pm}\rangle = |\phi_k\rangle + \frac{1}{E-H_0\pm i\epsilon}V
         |\psi_E^{\pm}\rangle \;, 
\]
!et
     is satisfied.
     Here $E = k^2/m$ and the plane wave state satisfies $H_0 |\phi_k\rangle = E |\phi_k\rangle$.
     Why do you need the $\pm i\epsilon$?
!esubex

!bsubex
We can define the $T$-matrix on-shell as the transition matrix that acting on the plane wave state 
    yields the same result as the potential acting on the full scattering state.  That is,
     $T^{(\pm)}(E = k^2/m)|\phi_k\rangle = V |\psi_E^{\pm}\rangle$. 
    What does it mean that the $T$-matrix is *on-shell*? (This is a really quick question!) 
!esubex

!bsubex
     Show that matrix elements of the $T$-matrix satisfy the Lippmann-Schwinger equation
!bt
\[
       \langle {\bf k}'|T^{(\pm)}(E)|{\bf k}\rangle =
       \langle {\bf k}'|V|{\bf k}\rangle +
       \int\! d^3p\, \frac{\langle {\bf k}'|V|{\bf p}\rangle
         \langle {\bf p}|T^{(\pm)}(E)|{\bf k}\rangle}{E-\frac{p^2}{m}\pm i\epsilon}.
\]
!et
    What normalization is used for the momentum states?
    Are the matrix elements of the $T$-matrix on the right side on-shell?

!esubex

!bsubex
    Write the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the wave function in coordinate space for a local potential $V = V({\bf r})$.
    To this end, show first that the free Green's function 
!bt
\[
      G^{\pm}({\bf r}',{\bf r}; E = k^2/m) = \langle {\bf r} | \frac{1}{E-H_0\pm i\epsilon} | {\bf r}'\rangle,
\]
!et
is given by 
!bt
\[
       G^{\pm}({\bf r}',{\bf r}; E = k^2/m) = 
          -\frac{m}{4\pi}\frac{e^{\pm ik|{\bf r}-{\bf r}'|}}{|{\bf r}-{\bf r}'|}.
\]
!et
!esubex

!bsubex
Show that when the $T$-matrix is evaluated on-shell, it is proportional to the scattering amplitude, $T^+(E =k^2/m) = -\frac{1}{4\pi^2 m}f(k,\theta)$, by analyzing the asymptotic form of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and comparing to
!bt
\[
       \langle {\bf r} | \psi_E^+ \rangle \stackrel{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} 
         (2\pi)^{-3/2} \left( e^{i\bm{k\cdot r}} + f(k,\theta) \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \right).
 \]
!et

!esubex

!bsubex
Start from the momentum-space partial wave expansion of the potential,
!bt
\[
    \langle {\bf k'} | V | {\bf k} \rangle
    = \frac{2}{\pi}\sum_{l,m} V_l(k',k)Y^{\ast}_{lm}(\Omega_{k'})Y_{lm}(\Omega_k),
\]
!et
    and a similar expansion of the $T$-matrix to 
    derive the partial wave version of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation (with the
    correct factor for the integral):
!bt
\[
     T_l(k',k;E) = V_l(k',k) + \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\infty \! dp\, p^2
      \frac{V_l(k',q)T_l(q,k;E)}{E - p^2/m + i\epsilon}.
\]
!et


!esubex


!bsubex
Scattering phase shifts for a square well potential. Calculate the S-wave scattering phase shifts for an attractive
    square-well potential $V(r) = -V_0 \theta(R-r)$ and show that
!bt
\[
       \delta_0(E) = \arctan\left[
         \sqrt{\frac{E}{E+V_0}}\tan\bigl(R\sqrt{2\mu(E+V_0)\bigr)}
         \right] - R\sqrt{2\mu E}.
\]
!et
!esubex


!bsubex
Let's consider the analytic structure of the corresponding partial-wave S matrix,
    which is given by
!bt
\[
      S_0(k) = e^{-2 i k R} \frac{k_0 \cot k_0 R + ik}{k_0 \cot k_0 R - ik},
\]
!et
where $E = k^2/2\mu$ and $k_0^2 = k^2 + 2\mu V_0$.
Show that $S_l(k) = e^{2i\delta_l(k)}$ for $l=0$ is satisfied. 
!bhint
Hint: write $e^{2i\delta} = e^{i\delta}/e^{-i\delta}$.
!ehint
Treat $S_0(k)$ as a function of the complex variable $k$ and find its  singularities.
!esubex

!bsubex
Bound states are associated with poles on the imaginary axis
     in the upper half plane.  Show that the condition for such a pole here gives
     the same eigenvalue condition (a transcendental equation) that you would get
     from a conventional solution to the square well by matching logarithmic derivatives. 
!bhint
Hint: Define $k= i\kappa$ with $\kappa>0$ when analyzing such a pole.
