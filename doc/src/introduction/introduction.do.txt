===== Brief overview of Quantum Chromydynamics (QCD) =====

* Quark-gluon degrees of freedom (DOF) are optimal to describe the strong force dynamics of nuclei.
* Nevertheless, the low-energy Effective Field Theory (EFT) that underpin our modern understanding if internucleon forces are clearly related to the underlying symmetries of QCD

* Moreover, as we will see later in the course, remarkable progress is being made in lattice QCD so that *dired* calculations of few-nucleon systems with nucleat forces are becoming closer to reality.

* Therefore, even though 95% of this corse will be devoted to a description in terms of nucleons and pions, it is useful to give a birdeye view of QCD.

* If you are not too familiar with quantum field theory or QCD. Our presentation here is necessarily impressionistic and meant only to remind you of what is governing things at a fundamental level.
