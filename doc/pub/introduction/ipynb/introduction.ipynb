    "* Quark-gluon degrees of freedom (DOF) are optimal to describe the strong force dynamics of nuclei.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nevertheless, the low-energy Effective Field Theory (EFT) that underpin our modern understanding if internucleon forces are clearly related to the underlying symmetries of QCD\n",
    "\n",
    "* Moreover, as we will see later in the course, remarkable progress is being made in lattice QCD so that *dired* calculations of few-nucleon systems with nucleat forces are becoming closer to reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Therefore, even though 95% of this course will be devoted to a description in terms of nucleons and pions, it is useful to give a bird's-eye view of QCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you are not too familiar with quantum field theory or QCD. Our presentation here is necessarily impressionistic and meant only to remind you of what is governing things at a fundamental level.\n",
