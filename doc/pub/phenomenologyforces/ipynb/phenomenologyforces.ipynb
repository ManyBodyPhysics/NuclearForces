    " The nuclear forces are almost charge independent. If we assume they are, \n",
    "we can introduce a new quantum number which is conserved. For nucleons only, that is a proton and neutron, we can limit ourselves\n",
    "to two possible values which allow us to distinguish between the two particles. If we assign an isospin value of $\\tau=1/2$ for protons\n",
    "and neutrons (they belong to an isospin doublet, in the same way as we discussed the spin $1/2$ multiplet), we can define \n",
    "the neutron to have isospin projection $\\tau_z=+1/2$ and a proton to have $\\tau_z=-1/2$. These assignements are the standard choices in low-energy nuclear physics.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The existence of the deuteron with $J^{\\pi}=1^+$ indicates that the force between protons and neutrons is attractive at least for the $^3S_1$ partial wave.
