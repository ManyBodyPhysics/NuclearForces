<h2 id="___sec0">Exercise 1: Questions on the Overview of QCD </h2>

<p>
This collection of problems contain short exercises and discussion questions on QCD.

<p>
<b>a)</b>
With respect to what scale(s) are the \( c,b,t \) quarks called heavy?

<p>
<b>b)</b>
Have you heard about the \( s \) quark before? If yes, in what context?

<p>
<b>c)</b>
A possible way to <em>see</em> quarks and gluons is in jets. What happens in these events?

<p>
<b>d)</b>
Using the <a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">Particle Data Group website</a>, discuss which properties of the
neutron and proton are similar and what are differences? What about for the three pions?

<p>
<b>e)</b>
Which is more important in making a neutron more massive than a proton: the light quark mass difference or the electromagnetic
contribution? Or do you think such considerations are too simplistic?

<p>
<b>f)</b>
What is the evidence for <em>spontaneous</em> chiral symmetry  breaking in

<ul>
   <li> the mass spectrum of pseudoscalar (\( J^\pi = 0^- \)) mesons;</li>
   <li> the mass spectrum of vector and axial vector (\( J^\pi = 1^\mp \)) mesons?</li>
</ul>

<b>g)</b>
What is the evidence for <em>explicit</em> chiral symmetry breaking
      in the  spectrum of pseudoscalar (\( J^\pi = 0^- \)) mesons?

<p>
<b>h)</b>
If you and your friend each do a QCD calculation with the
      same diagrams but use \( \alpha_s \) at different scales, will you
      get the same answer? If not, how could that happen?

<p>
<b>i)</b>
Does the running coupling in QCD mean that the QCD
      Hamiltonian is not unique? Would you say that if you used
      \( \alpha_s \) at two different scales that you were using two
      different Hamiltonians?

<p>
<b>j)</b>
If the neutron lifetime is so short, why are there <em>any</em> stable nuclei?

<p>
<b>k)</b>
One observes a marked resonance when a \( \pi^+ \) pion is
      scattering off a proton. Which baryon does this correspond to
      and at which energy of the \( \pi^+ \) does this occur (the proton
      is at rest)?

<p>
<b>l)</b>
At sufficient energy in proton-proton collisions it is
      possible to create a pion, \( p + p \rightarrow p + n + \pi^+ \). At
      which energy in the center-of-mass frame does pion production
      start?

<h2 id="___sec1">Exercise 2: Basic Scattering Theory </h2>

<p>
<b>a)</b>
We typically use units in which \( \hbar=c=1 \) and express
      quantities as powers of MeV or fm or both, using \( \hbar c\approx 197.33 \) MeVfm to convert between them. If we take for the nucleon
      mass \( M_N=939 \) MeV/$c^2$, what is \( \hbar^2/M_N \) numerically
      in terms of MeV and fm?

<p>
<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
Hint: This should be almost immediate if you insert the right factors of \( c \).

<p>
<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>b)</b>
For the scattering of equal mass (nonrelativistic) particles, 
      if the laboratory energy \( E_{\rm lab} \) is related to the magnitude of the relative momentum 
      \( k_{\rm rel} \) (i.e., the momentum each particle has in the center-of-mass
      frame) by \( E_{\rm lab} = C k_{\rm rel}^2 \), what is \( C \)?  If the mass
      is \( M_N=939 \) MeV, what is the value of \( C \) in MeVfm$^2$?

<p>
<b>c)</b>
We write the partial-wave momentum space Schroedinger equation (<a href="https://manybodyphysics.github.io/NuclearForces/doc/pub/scatteringtheory/html/scatteringtheory.html" target="_blank">see Lecture notes</a>) as
$$
\frac{k^2}{2\mu}\langle klm | \psi \rangle + \frac{2}{\pi}\sum_{l'm'}
        \int_0^\infty\! dk'\,k'{}^2\, 
        \langle klm | V | k'l'm' \rangle \langle k'l'm' | \psi \rangle = E_k \langle klm | \psi \rangle \;,
$$

      what are the units of \( V_{ll'}(k,k') \equiv   \langle klm | V | k'l'm \rangle \)? In coordinate space the potential is local, \( V(r) \), with units of MeV, and \( k \) is given in inverse fm.  If you see a plot in a journal
      article
      of \( V_{ll'}(k,k') \) with units of fm, how would you convert it to the units you just found?

<p>

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
Hint: use the results from the first exercise here.

<p>
<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>d)</b>
In Figure 18 of the review by Scott Bogner <em>et al.</em>,
      <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146641010000347?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Prog.  Nucl. Part. Phys. <b>65</b>, 94 (2010)</a> the momentum-space
      matrix elements of different chiral effective field theory
      potentials are given in units of fm. Consider the value at zero
      relative momenta. 
      \( \tilde{C}_{^1S_0} \), see Eq.&nbsp;(2.5) and 
     the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375947404010747" target="_blank">article by Epelbaum</a> <em>et al.</em>  in GeV$^{-2}$. How do you convert
      to fm units? Do the values for the matrix elements then match?

<p>
<b>e)</b>
What do <em>on-shell</em> and <em>off-shell</em> mean in the context of scattering?

<p>
<b>f)</b>
Under what conditions is a partial-wave expansion of the potential useful?

<p>
<b>g)</b>
Derive the standard result:
$$
       \frac{e^{i\delta_l(k)}\sin\delta_l(k)}{k}
            = \frac{1}{k\cot\delta_l(k) - i k}
$$

<p>
<b>h)</b>
Given a potential that is not identically zero as \( r\rightarrow\infty \) (e.g., a Yukawa),
     how would you know in practice where the asymptotic (large \( r \)) region starts?

<p>
<b>i)</b>
What is the physical interpretation of the relation between the (partial-wave)
    \( S \)-matrix and the scattering amplitude?  (Note that \( S_l(k) = 1 + 2 i k f_l(k) \).)

<p>

<h2 id="___sec2">Exercise 3: More on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation </h2>

<p>
<b>a)</b>
Using the Schr\"odinger equation for the scattering of two particles with mass \( m \),
$$
       (H_0 + V)|\psi_E\rangle = E |\psi_E\rangle \;,
$$

     where \( H_0 \) is the free Hamiltonian, show that the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the wave function,
$$
       |\psi_E^{\pm}\rangle = |\phi_k\rangle + \frac{1}{E-H_0\pm i\epsilon}V
         |\psi_E^{\pm}\rangle \;, 
$$

     is satisfied.
     Here \( E = k^2/m \) and the plane wave state satisfies \( H_0 |\phi_k\rangle = E |\phi_k\rangle \).
     Why do you need the \( \pm i\epsilon \)?

<p>
<b>b)</b>
We can define the \( T \)-matrix on-shell as the transition matrix that acting on the plane wave state 
    yields the same result as the potential acting on the full scattering state.  That is,
     \( T^{(\pm)}(E = k^2/m)|\phi_k\rangle = V |\psi_E^{\pm}\rangle \). 
    What does it mean that the \( T \)-matrix is <em>on-shell</em>? (This is a really quick question!)

<p>
<b>c)</b>
Show that matrix elements of the \( T \)-matrix satisfy the Lippmann-Schwinger equation
$$
       \langle {\bf k}'|T^{(\pm)}(E)|{\bf k}\rangle =
       \langle {\bf k}'|V|{\bf k}\rangle +
       \int\! d^3p\, \frac{\langle {\bf k}'|V|{\bf p}\rangle
         \langle {\bf p}|T^{(\pm)}(E)|{\bf k}\rangle}{E-\frac{p^2}{m}\pm i\epsilon}.
$$

    What normalization is used for the momentum states?
    Are the matrix elements of the \( T \)-matrix on the right side on-shell?

<p>
<b>d)</b>
Write the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the wave function in coordinate space for a local potential \( V = V({\bf r}) \).
    To this end, show first that the free Green's function 
$$
      G^{\pm}({\bf r}',{\bf r}; E = k^2/m) = \langle {\bf r} | \frac{1}{E-H_0\pm i\epsilon} | {\bf r}'\rangle,
$$

is given by 
$$
       G^{\pm}({\bf r}',{\bf r}; E = k^2/m) = 
          -\frac{m}{4\pi}\frac{e^{\pm ik|{\bf r}-{\bf r}'|}}{|{\bf r}-{\bf r}'|}.
$$

<p>
<b>e)</b>
Show that when the \( T \)-matrix is evaluated on-shell, it is proportional to the scattering amplitude, \( T^+(E =k^2/m) = -\frac{1}{4\pi^2 m}f(k,\theta) \), by analyzing the asymptotic form of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and comparing to
$$
       \langle {\bf r} | \psi_E^+ \rangle \stackrel{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} 
         (2\pi)^{-3/2} \left( e^{i\boldsymbol{k\cdot r}} + f(k,\theta) \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} \right).
 $$

<p>
<b>f)</b>
Start from the momentum-space partial wave expansion of the potential,
$$
    \langle {\bf k'} | V | {\bf k} \rangle
    = \frac{2}{\pi}\sum_{l,m} V_l(k',k)Y^{\ast}_{lm}(\Omega_{k'})Y_{lm}(\Omega_k),
$$

    and a similar expansion of the \( T \)-matrix to 
    derive the partial wave version of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation (with the
    correct factor for the integral):
$$
     T_l(k',k;E) = V_l(k',k) + \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\infty \! dp\, p^2
      \frac{V_l(k',q)T_l(q,k;E)}{E - p^2/m + i\epsilon}.
$$

<p>
<b>g)</b>
Scattering phase shifts for a square well potential. Calculate the S-wave scattering phase shifts for an attractive
    square-well potential \( V(r) = -V_0 \theta(R-r) \) and show that
$$
       \delta_0(E) = \arctan\left[
         \sqrt{\frac{E}{E+V_0}}\tan\bigl(R\sqrt{2\mu(E+V_0)\bigr)}
         \right] - R\sqrt{2\mu E}.
$$

<p>
<b>h)</b>
Let's consider the analytic structure of the corresponding partial-wave S matrix,
    which is given by
$$
      S_0(k) = e^{-2 i k R} \frac{k_0 \cot k_0 R + ik}{k_0 \cot k_0 R - ik},
$$

where \( E = k^2/2\mu \) and \( k_0^2 = k^2 + 2\mu V_0 \).
Show that \( S_l(k) = e^{2i\delta_l(k)} \) for \( l=0 \) is satisfied. 
Treat \( S_0(k) \) as a function of the complex variable \( k \) and find its  singularities.

<p>
<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
Hint: write \( e^{2i\delta} = e^{i\delta}/e^{-i\delta} \).

<p>
<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>i)</b>
Bound states are associated with poles on the imaginary axis
     in the upper half plane.  Show that the condition for such a pole here gives
     the same eigenvalue condition (a transcendental equation) that you would get
     from a conventional solution to the square well by matching logarithmic derivatives.

<p>
<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
Hint: Define \( k= i\kappa \) with \( \kappa>0 \) when analyzing such a pole.
